    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste

            </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter

            </li>
            <li>Â¼ cup shredded Emmentaler cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <strong>Step 1</strong>
            <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.

            </li>
            <strong>Step 2</strong>
            <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
            <strong>Step 3</strong>
            <li>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. Cook until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.

            </li>
        </ol>
